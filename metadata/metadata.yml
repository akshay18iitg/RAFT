name: Deep Recurrent Optical Flow Learning for Particle Image Velocimetry Data
description: "This is the official PyTorch implementation of Deep Recurrent Optical Flow Learning for Particle Image Velocimetry Data published in Nature Machine Intelligence.  In this work, we propose a deep neural network-based approach for learning displacement fields in an end-to-end manner, focusing on the specific case of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). \nPIV is a key approach in experimental fluid dynamics and of fundamental importance in diverse applications, including automotive, aerospace, and biomedical engineering.  In contrast to standard PIV methods, our RAFT-PIV approach is general, largely automated, and provides much higher spatial resolution."
